# Java Multiplicative-Persistance

## For example, take the number 5456. Multiple all the digits by each other, you get:
## 5 * 4 * 5 * 6 = 600
## 6 * 0 * 0 = 0

## The goal is to take as long as possible to get to a single digit. As in the above examples, zeros and fives are certain death.
## Let's try 333.
## 3 * 3 * 3 = 27
## 2 * 7 = 14
## 1 * 4 = 4

## And you can try this for other numbers. This program converts numbers to strings, seprates them and gives the user the persistence value.
